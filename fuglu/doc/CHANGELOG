 	* now supports header wildcard (Character '*')
 	* accepts colon at the end
 	* alias "from_address" for envelope_from and "to_address" for envelope_to
 	* new type: 'mime:<headername>' to check mime headers in all attachments
 	* new type: 'body:stripped'  (or just 'body') to match all text parts with html tags removed and newlines replaced by space
 	* new type: 'body:raw' to match the decoded body in all text/* parts
 	* new type: 'body:full' to match the full undecoded body
