-- Fuglu 0.4.6
 * started changelog ;-)
 * bugfix: Milter protocol errors
 * bugfix: Incorrect unquoting of two leading dots in smtp transactions could lead to broken s/mime sigs
 * A few plugins now have a 'PROBLEMACTION' so it is now configurable if a message should be deferred or accepted if for example the clamav daemon is not reachable
 * new option: [main] trashlog (boolean), default False, if True, Fuglu writes a 00-fuglutrash.log file in the trashdir listing all deleted messages
 * SuspectFilters (previously 'HeaderFilters'): 
 	* now supports header wildcard (Character '*')
 	* accepts colon at the end
 	* alias "from_address" for envelope from and "to_address" for envelope_to
 	* new type: 'mime:<headername>' to check mime headers in all attachments
 	* new type: 'body:stripped'  (or just 'body') to match all text parts with html tags removed and newlines replaced by space
 	* new type: 'body:raw' to match the decoded body in all text/* parts
 	* new type: 'body:full' to match the full undecoded body
 	* bugfix: regexes now match everywhere in the field, not just at the beginning
 * Attachment Plugin:
 	* Configuration of attachment rules can now be read from a database table (sql extension)
 	* Support rule configuration from sql
 	* Support both 'python-magic' and 'python-file' libraries
 	* Improved log messages
 	* "BOUNCE" action has been removed and replaced with the config option 'sendbounce'
 * Archive Plugin:
 	* Allow archive exception rules (append "no" to the regex)
 	* Messages are now stored as '<suspect-id>.eml' instead of a random string
 * Clamav Plugin:
 	* Virusaction is now configurable
 * Spamassassin Plugin:
 	* now Supports lowspam / highspam configuration
 	* new option "scanoriginal" -> Scans the unmodified original message (not the probably modified version from other plugins)
 	* new option "forwardoriginal" -> Does forward the original message source to the next plugin, without modified SA-Headers

Developers:
 * Suspects now also have a "highspam" tag which allows different behavior based on whether a message is "probably" or "definitely" spam
 * if a plugin cant be loaded, a full stack trace is displayed
 * Appenderplugins can now read the tag "injectanswer" which contains the final smtp answer from SMTP reinjects
 * (sql extension) DBFiles allow reading sql tables and treat them like config files
